## Project Description & Overview
Build a multi AI agent application using Langflow, a drag-and-drop AI flow editor.
The system integrates Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to fetch relevant data from databases or documents.
The project demonstrates a customer support agent that can:
Access order details (status, cancellation).
Look up product information.
Answer FAQs using company documents (PDFs).
The system combines multiple AI agents with a manager agent that routes queries to the appropriate tool/agent.
The AI system is extendable and usable in real-world business scenarios.
